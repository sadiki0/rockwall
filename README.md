# My Rockwall Website Port

The current city website looks outdated and could be a little cooler.
So I went ahead an decided to make a side-project out of updating it's design.

## Installation for developers

First you should probably clone this repository:

`git clone https://github.com/sadiki0/rockwall.git`

After cloning you need to install the required node packages using:

`npm install`

You have now installed the website for developing!

## Starting the Development Server

Run the command: `npm start` to start a vite development server

## Building for production

Simple easy. Run the command: `npm build` to compile the website.
